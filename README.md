**Describe the difference between the fixed, wrap content and match constraint setting of the constraint layout?**

With the fix setting you are able to make a dimension to your need. With wrap content the view expands only as much as needed to fit its contents. By using match constraints you can expand the view as much as possible to meet the constraints on each side. You are also able to modify the behavior with attributes and values. These are layout\_constraintWidth\_default, layout\_constraintWidth\_min and layout\_constraintWidth\_max.

Purpose of the manifest file is to hold data about the jar files and the classes that it contains. It also describes essential info about your app for the android build tools, OS and google play.
